    Changes in v1.5.2:
    - Added a new "Time::FromEpoch" function in "Time.hpp/cpp" which converts a epoch timestamp into the "Time" class.
    - Fixed the rotate functions in "Math.hpp/cpp" using "RADIANS_TO_ROTATION" instead of "DEGREES_TO_RADIANS" for applying rotation, also remade them to be more clear of what they do.

    Changes in v1.5.1:
    - BREAKING: Renamed the "Timestamp::FormatStandard" function to "Timestamp::FormatClock" in "Time.hpp/cpp".
    - Added a new "Time::FromEpoch" function for the time class that parses an epoch timestamp in "Time.hpp/cpp".
    - Added two new timestamp format functions "Timestamp::FormatUTCSimple" and "Timestamp::FormatUTCExtended" in "Time.hpp/cpp".
    - Added two new helper functions "ConsoleComponent::CreateTimestampUTCSimple" and "ConsoleComponent::CreateTimestampUTCExtended" in "Console.hpp/cpp".

    Changes in v1.5.0:
    - Added a new "ManagerComponent::OnCanvasDraw" function to control all the individual canvas drawing functions for each module, this should be called by your hud render function.
    - Added a new virtual void "Module::OnCreateVariables" for modules where you can create module specific settings or commands instead of putting them all in the "ManagerComponent::Initialize()" function. This is called by the "ManagerComponent::CreateModule" function in "Manager.cpp".
    - Changed the "UpdateSettings" function from the placeholdder mod to be a virtual void and renamed it to "OnSettingChanged", this should be called by your function when its value has changed.
    - Added a new virtual void "Module::OnCanvasDraw" for modules, this is called by the new "ManagerComponent::OnCanvasDraw" function in "Manager.cpp".
    - The "ManagerComponent::OnTick" function is now called by the new "ManagerComponent::OnCanvasDraw" function in "Manager.cpp".

     Changes in v1.4.9:
    - Added two new settings for commands called "IsLocked" and "NeedsArgs", locked prevents the command from being called, and needs args states that the command requires some sort of argument to be passed through. Setting this false means arguments are optional for the command.
    - Added a new "Variable" class which both the "Setting" and "Command" class now inherit from, this stores the variable and internal flags / permissions for said variable.
    - Added two new internal constants, "VARIABLE_NAME_LENGTH" and "VARIABLE_VALUE_LENGTH", in Manager.cpp" which let you set the max length for variable values and names.
    - BREAKING: Made the "ManagerComponent::CreateVariable" functon private, as a result the "CreateCommand" and "CreateSetting" now require an additional argument for creating them for their names.
    - BREAKING: Got rid of all the optional constructors for the "Setting" class in "Manager.hpp/cpp", you should now call the setter functions to bind specific callbacks or set permissions.
    - BREAKING: Renamed the "IsSearchable" function for the command and setting classes to to "IsHidden" in "Manager.hpp/cpp".
    - BREAKING: Renamed the "Command::BindCallback" function to "Command::BindStringCallback" in "Manager.hpp/cpp".

    Changes in v1.4.7:
    - Added extra null checking and safety checks for both "Instances.hpp/cpp" and "Events.cpp".
    - Removed the "MarkForDestroy" loop in "Instances.cpp" in the deconstructor, if they were already deleted by the game then this would be accessing random memory addresses (which is bad).

    Changes in v1.4.6:
    - Added two new functions "ProcessBefore" and "ProcessAfter" to "Events.hpp/cpp" to more easily process function hooks, this makes detouring multiple things such as process event and call function easier.
    - Added a new atomic bool to "EventsComponent" to prevent a thread racing issue when hooking functions.

    Changes in v1.4.5:
    - Wrapped all the extensions and helper classes in a new "CodeRed" namespace, this is to prevent possible naming conflicts with other libraries.
    - BREAKING: Removed the "UnrealMemory.hpp/cpp" files from "Extensions" as it was unnecessary to have in the first place.

    - Added a new "HooksComponent" in "Events.hpp/cpp", this is to be used in place of the "Hooks" namespace.

    - Renamed all the class variables in "Manager.hpp/cpp" to be consistent with the rest of the project.

    - Fixed the "MarkInvincible" and "MarkForDestroy" functions in "Instances.cpp" using the wrong flags.
