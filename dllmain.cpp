/*
    Changes in v1.0.4:
    - Added an option to blacklist events from going through Process Event.
    - Added a global rainbow color class in "Colors.hpp", and remade "FColorList".
    - Remade how function hooks are found in "EventsComponent", it now maps out all functions internal index and their name.
    - Made console logging more efficient if you were using multiple functions that used different colors.
    - Made the "GetTimestamp" function static.

    Changes in v1.0.3:
    - Changed typedef for post function hooks.
    - Made the States enum a normal enum instead of an enum class to reduce the need to cast to its underlying type.
    - Added an "Initialized" private member for modules.
    - Made modules initialize first, then function hooks/instances.
